<h1>Ti.OneTok</h1>
 
Welcome to the OneTok Titanium module project.

This project provides Titanium access to the OneTok SDK.

<h2>About OneTok</h2>
OneTok provides developers with a simple and flexible infrastructure for building voice recognition controls into mobile apps.

The OneTok SDK has been developed as part of the OneTok Voice Platform to provide to mobile app developers a simple and easy way to add voice controls to their mobile apps. The OneTok SDK consists of a native library for iOS, Android (Blackberry and Windows Phone) as well as a series of web accessible, network-based services including voice recognition, grammars and natural language processing.

<h2>Getting Started With OneTok</h2>
	
* Create a developer account on [Onetok.com](http://Onetok.com)
* Create a new app
* Add an App Name
* Select an App Category, which will associate the app with a selection of pre-defined methods and sample sentences (e.g. for the banking category this will include methods such as getBalance, findAtm, findBranch, showTransactions and transferFunds and all of their corresponding sample sentences).

Once your app has been created OneTok will generate an App ID and App Token that the developer will use to uniquely identify their app when interacting with the OneTok API.
	
Your App Keys are then provided the Ti.OneTok's authentication method.
